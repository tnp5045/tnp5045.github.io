<h1>Empathetic AI Opportunities</h1>

<h2>Improved Customer Interaction</h2>

<ul><em><p>Current AI chatbots do not have empathetic AI. 
“Machines can frustrate people if they cannot understand what the people are saying, deliver inaccurate or inappropriate answers, or simply do not live up to promises made about them” (Chui, M. 2017). 
When customers interact with these chatbots they often walk away with a negative experience as not only do they rarely solve their queries, but they also do not tailor the experience to their current emotional state whether that is Angry or confused etc.
</p>

<p>With an empathetic AI chatbot system, Queries which have strong emotional influences on the phrasing of customer queries could get solved quickly. 
For example, if a customer was angry and was writing somewhat incoherent questions or comments due to their frustration via incorrect spelling, various slang and possibly typing speed. 
Empathetic AI would be able to quickly adapt and try to elicit the problem via empathetic means of communication. This would in-turn solve the problem quickly.</p>

<p>When we talk to current AI chatbots it is very easy to quickly understand that we are talking to AI which has pre-programmed responses. 
Therefore, an AI that can adapt to emotional cues and sentence patterns that go with them. 
The customer would no longer feel like they are talking to an AI system and be more likely to be satisfied with the customer service they received.</p>

<p>When AI chatbots fail to comprehend customers it then forces the customer to then try to contact a human customer service employee. When this happens the employees get the customers emotions unleashed onto the employee which can cause a great amount of stress to the employee. Having an Empathetic chatbot that can comprehend the customers emotion and avoid these scenarios would alleviate the stress from these employees. Therefore, customer service satisfaction rates would be expected to improve in the sector.
</p></em></ul>

<h2>Cost-Effectiveness</h2>

<ul><em><p>Maintaining a large customer service department can be costly. With empathetic AI, businesses can streamline their customer service operations.</p>

<p>If empathetic AI was integrated successfully, it would of course make most if not all customer service roles absolute. 
But would free up funds that was currently being spent on customer employee salaries which would in turn then be able to be used elsewhere in the business.</p>
  
<p>With the lack of customer service roles, this would mean that HR would be able to spend lest resources hiring and sourcing customer service roles and start to focus more on other areas in the business. 
Such as IT for the maintaining for the empathetic AI system.</p>
  
<p>Customer service roles would become absolute but that doesn't necessarily mean people will lose their jobs. 
If the company wanted to maintain a standard of morals and respect and not lay of their valuable employees. They could assign them into other departments. 
The AI could possibly not even be 100% and they could do simple prompt assists across multiple customer queries simultaneously.</p>
    
<p>Having an actual customer service department is expensive mostly because of peoples salaries. Research shows that changing your customer service role to AI saves the company 30% annually. 
Server hosting an empathetic AI system would is very cost effective when compared to employee salaries and other related costs.</p></em></ul>
  
<h2>Scalability</h2>
<ul><em><p>AI adoption outside of tech is not common and often at a very experimental stage (Chui, M. 2017). As companies expand, the volume of customer interactions also increases. Empathetic AI can reduce real customer query response. 
Scaling a customer service department requires that you can depend on HR to find people to hire and/or have the location also.</p>
  
<p>Having an empathetic AI system would drastically improve customer service optimization. 
A more personalized and efficient service would improve customer satisfaction. 
This would also bring consistent quality without the need to increase customer service personal.</p>
  
<p>Currently improvements from customer service come from recorded calls or surveys. 
Having an empathetic AI system would mean the system itself can understand emotions. 
The system would then in theory be able to collect vast amounts of data from its interaction based on the emotional responses which would help businesses make decisions and changes to increase scalability and growth.</p>
   
<p>The product or service the company is selling would also be able to scale. 
Empathetic AI could analyse emotional responses to queries to find out what parts of the product or service gives satisfies them the most or vice versa gives them the most grief. 
This kind of data would improve product or service development by understanding the customers emotions around different aspects of the product or service.</p></em></ul>

<h2>Data Analysis</h2>
<ul><em><p>AI mainly uses algorithms to learn iteratively from data to find insightful information without being programmed where to look for a particular piece of information (SAS Institute, 2017). 
By gathering a wealth of information from customer interactions, such as customer preferences, common complaints, and purchasing behaviour 'to improve the customer experience by increasing the company's knowledge about those customers' (Ameen, N., Tarhini, A., Reppel, A., & Anand, A., 2021).</p>

<p>This technology relies on the system to be able to analyse large volumes of data to understand customer sentiments, needs and preferences. 
Then the AI can copy human-like interactions. Making a more personalized experience. 
Huang, M. H., & Rust, R. T. (2021) made the comment about how it would benefit repeat customers using the AI as it would already have a dataset on the kind of emotional personality they have.</p>
  
<p>Predictive analysis for proactive service with data analysis that comes from learning from human emotions, the system can learn and understand customer problems or needs before they even arise. 
Which would make the customer service support more 'proactive' rather than 'reactive'. 
For example, if the customer is Angry, it would suggest there is something extremely wrong with product / service. If the customer is happy, it is then most likely something of a non-urgent matter.
AI makes decisions based on a large range of data to gain insights into the most appropriate response. 
But this doesn't include data about the emotions of the user. 
If the system could understand this kind of data, it would then make more informed decisions and solve problems more effectively. This could potentially reduce response time and increase user satisfaction.</p>
  
With understand of emotions from users, it would be a whole new sector of data for it to run through its machine learning by analysing is large dataset of interactions and emotional responses. This continuous learning would lead to a more empathetic and effective AI system.
