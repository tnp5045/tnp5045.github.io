<h1>Technology Choices</h1>

</ul><h2>Technical Limitations:</h2>
</ul><p>Artificial Intelligence will have its technical limitations for certain variables that it wasn’t designed to take account for. 
If we want empathetic AI to benefit customer service, emotions are one of the key points it needs to understand. 
If it knows what the customer’s current emotion is, it will know how to act accordingly. 
Or it could perhaps even understand that certain actions will trigger certain emotions which they’ll need to avoid if it sparks anger, or go through with it if it leaves the customer to be satisfied.

</ul><p>It isn’t just emotions that the AI will need to learn. 
It will need to know certain phrases/sayings, to prevent misunderstandings. 
Slang also needs to be understood by the AI for the same reason of preventing miscommunication. 
Accents are also another thing to add, as the AI’s voice recognition may not realize what the customer is saying because their pronunciation is different from what they know.

</ul><p>Misunderstandings and/or miscommunication will only lead to problems for both the company and the customer, and if such happens, the company’s customer service will take a hit as others will spread about their negative experience from it. 
Therefore it is important for the AI to understand these things the same way we do, to prevent this. 

</ul><p>If an empathetic AI were to be used, it would learn what has been mentioned above. 
But customers may not like interacting with a machine rather than a human like them. 
We’d need the AI to have emotions themselves to counteract this. 
It’ll process its available emotions before it generates the appropriate emotion. 
This generated emotion will then influence the AI’s system to carry out their goal with the customer in mind (Pfeifer et al., 1988).

</ul><h2>Transparency:</h2>
</ul><p>People can be apprehensive about artificial intelligence, especially if they have no knowledge about what data they collect and for what purpose they’ll be used for (Berscheid et al., 2019). 
Such concerns can be lifted if they were told about the data collection. 
The AI and its company will need to be transparent about this to their customers. 
With the AI, this can be achieved by reciting something similar to a Terms & Conditions to let the customer know what they’re agreeing to. 
That way, they’re able to decide whether the data collection is something they’ll consent to or not. 
This transparency might even build some trust from the customers, as this sort of transparency shows that the company doesn't hide these sorts of things from them. 
Because of this trust, they may be willing to trust the company’s AI as well.<p>

</ul><h2>Workforce Transition:</h2>
</ul><p>There are concerns of employment due to artificial intelligence replacing them. 
To prevent this, companies will have to make changes in their workforce. 
Perhaps, the company could make their employees work with the AI. 
An example could be that the employees could help the AI understand the customer’s intentions and/or queries.

</ul><p>This would certainly help in limiting misunderstandings and helps the customer service to go smoothly. 
Or when an employee is not able to attend their workplace, an AI can be their substitute instead so that the waiting time isn’t long due to a limited amount of people only being able to answer to the customers. 

</ul><p>These are just a few examples involving artificial intelligence that could be done. 
There can be more that others could think of that can end up being beneficial to the company, without losing their human workers. 
If the unemployment of human workers due to artificial intelligence were to become common, it would cause a great amount of dislike from many others. 
From this, it is likely that it will cause a riot and actions against AI replacing humans may be taken.

</ul><h2>Risk Management:</h2>
</ul><p>All AI are not going to be made perfect, which is why errors and malfunctions will eventually happen with artificial intelligence. These errors in the system could end up bad to a point where it has deviated from its original function. 
Before artificial intelligence is implemented in customer service and such, it must be tested and be cleared by the experts in artificial intelligence that it will work fine. 
There’s even the possible legal issues that may surface because of artificial intelligence, where it must be fair. With the proposal of empathetic AI, an error could lead it to be unfair, which is why it really must be cleared in the first place before it is used for its intention. 

</ul><p>Security must also be accounted for, so a third-party wouldn’t be able to access the AI itself easily. 
Or perhaps there’s also the scenario where the AI cannot access certain data until cleared by a human personnel. 
This is so that data of customers or company secrets won’t be stolen and there are various ways to go about this.

</ul><p>There are so many variables to consider if one wants to minimize the risks and errors of artificial intelligence, especially an empathetic AI that is meant to communicate with customers. 
And a company surely wants to consider these things if they want their customer service to be a success (Yigitcanlar et al., 2020).
